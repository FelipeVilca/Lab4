Application for practicing vocabulary there the program can create and edit glossaries in different languages. You can practice on words from the lists you have entered yourself. The program is available in two versions: a version that runs in a terminal (console app), as well as a version with GUI (winforms). The two applications shares code in a common library (class library). Each dictionary is saved as a separate file with the file extension .dat, and the name of the file is the name of the list. For example, 'mywords.dat'. The first line of the file contains the name of languages, separated by semicolons. Then follows a line for each word, with the translations separated by semicolons. All .dat files are stored in a folder with the same name as the application below user's app data \ local. If the folder does not already exist, it is created by the application.
